    ----------
    base_url: str
        The base URL for all API calls.
    auth: Authentication
        The authentication manager to obtain tokens for API requests.
    http_client: HTTPClient
        The HTTP client responsible for making actual HTTP requests.
    headers: dict
        The default headers to be included in every request.

    Methods:
    -------
    send_request(request: HTTPRequest) -> HTTPResponse:
        Sends an HTTP request using the HTTPClient and returns the response. It automatically
        adds an authorization header to the request using a valid token from the Authentication instance.
